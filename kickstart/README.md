# Chapeau Kickstarts

These files are used to build the Chapeau live image with the livecd-creator tool.  
The main kickstart file to call is chapeau-{version}.ks

Starting from Chapeau 21 the main kickstart has been split into multiple kickstarts.  
Therefore to build Chapeau 21 the following kickstarts are required;

chapeau-21.ks  
chapeau-base.ks  
chapeau-repos.ks  
chapeau-packages.ks
