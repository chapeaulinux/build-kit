# Chapeau Kickstarts

These files are used to build the Chapeau live image with the livecd-creator tool.
The main kickstart file to call is chapeau-{version}.ks

From Chapeau 21 the main kickstart was split into multiple kickstarts.
Therefore to build Chapeau 23 the following kickstarts are required;

chapeau-23.ks
chapeau-base-23.ks
chapeau-repos-23.ks
chapeau-packages-23.ks
